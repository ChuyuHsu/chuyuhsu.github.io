Few weeks ago, when I was doing the ICDM 2015 competition on Kaggle, Kaggle sent me job notifications every few days. So I was like, "Hey! Who would post jobs on Kaggle? Is there anyone actually read this?" 

Since our big project came to a milestone, we finally could have a little vacation. I just went to the east Taiwan. Then, a question came to my mind.

> 1. Where is your data science job?
> 2. What skill is required by these jobs for a candidate?
> 3. Who is recruiting our people? 

# Plan  

# Data sources

So I made a little plan to investigate the job opputtinities around the world. As any of data science problems, the data source always the number one headache. A few job websites we can get these imformation.

1. LinkedIn
2. Indeed.com
3. Kaggle
4. StackOverflow Career

Unfortunately, most websites above don't provide API to access jobs data we want.
