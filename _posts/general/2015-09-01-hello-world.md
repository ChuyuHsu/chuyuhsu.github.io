It has been a while since the idea of writing down somthing for myself came to me.
I'd always pondered how would my blog will be like? This is it, I guess.

The reason why I start to writing is quite ordinary. There are many things going on in my life. Met a girl, found the passion and I want all these stuffs to be record.

I want to put some stuff from what I've learned. So this blog blog is gonna be mixed up with machine learning, data mining and life of mine, and travelling, and anything else.
